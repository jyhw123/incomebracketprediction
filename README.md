# income bracket prediction
This project is focused on identifying factors that affect an American's income bracket (above or below $50k per annum). Doing so allows us to identify which areas the government may look to improve on so as to benefit and raise the living standards of Americans in the future, and simultaneously tackle potential divisive areas in American society.

We used a few different models, including Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Deep Learning with Neural Networks using Keras.

This project was done in a group for an external data science course.
